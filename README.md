## Coddin Laravel Preset

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel projectname
cd projectname
npx @preset/cli apply coddin-web/laravel-preset
```

## Contains

This preset contains an opinionated set of rules for PHPStan, PHPCS and PHPUnit.
It contains PHPStan's strict and deprecation rules and the very strict library "ergebnis".

Next to that a basic, but usable Bitbucket Pipelines file is included with a deployer file for CI and Deployment.
